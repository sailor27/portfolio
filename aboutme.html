          <h4>How to refer to me</h4>
          <p>My name is Sailor, and my pronouns are <em>they/them/their</em>.
          I benefit when my collaborators use the correct pronouns without help
          from me. <a href="https://lgbt.wisc.edu/documents/LGBTCC-Gender_pronoun_
          guide.pdf"><strong>Here</strong></a> is a resource guide about gender pronouns.

          <h4>My work history</h4>
          <p>I've worked plenty of service industry jobs, spent a two
          year period as a graduate student and English Composition instructor,
          and have been doing technology-related work for the last three years.<br><br>
          When I arrived in Portland in 2014, I was in immediate need of housing
          and employment. I started working at a call center supporting iOS
          devices, and later moved on to Apple CPU support.<br><br>
          That job was disempowering and paid $9.25/hr, but I discovered that I
          enjoyed troubleshooting issues and learning more about how Apple
          products work. I also found there a variety of other queer and trans
          people in similar situations to mine, a few of whom i still commiserate
          and collaborate with. From this point on, technology work is my survival
          strategy as well as my personal fascination.

          <h4>My role at <a href="http://www.peoples.coop">People's Food Co-op
          </a></h4>
          <p>Now, I work as the Technology Coordinator for a collectively-managed
          food co-op in SE Portland. Most of my Technology Coordinator role is
          project management, but I also install and implement
          systems and provide support to users. In addition, I work in and co-manage
          the retail store and serve as a Team Coordinator in the Personnel
          Coordinating Body.</p>

          <h4>Why I am learning programming</h4>
          <p>Learning to code is part of my personal long term survival strategy.
          I want to find work that sustains me, nourishes my desire to learn,
          and provides me opportunities to be treated as an equal contributing to a
          team.<br><br> I've always been fascinated by how the style and function
          of online space informs the human interactions within it. Before I left
          graduate school, I was writing about queer and trans people using tumblr
          and creating digital art installations.<br><br>
          I dream of improving or creating software tools that enable queer,
          anti-racist, feminist, and anti-capitalist action and survival. But
          also, I would love to be able to pay my rent and maybe even be able
          put up some of my friends who are houseless.
